# 📸 Add Your Headshot

To complete the stunning hero section, please add your professional headshot:

## Steps:

1. **Prepare your photo:**
   - Use a high-quality professional headshot
   - Recommended size: 800x800px or larger (square)
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Make sure it's well-lit and has a clean background

2. **Add to project:**
   - Save your photo as `headshot.jpg` or `headshot.png`
   - Place it in the `public` folder: `c:\Users\harsh\Downloads\personal-portfolio\public\`

3. **The hero section will automatically:**
   - Display your photo with a rotating gradient border
   - Add 3D mouse parallax effects
   - Show floating tech badges around it
   - Apply smooth animations and glow effects

## Alternative:
If you don't have a headshot ready, you can:
- Use a professional avatar/illustration
- Use a logo or personal brand mark
- The component will show a placeholder until you add your image

## File location:
```
personal-portfolio/
└── public/
    └── headshot.jpg  ← Place your photo here
```

Once added, refresh your browser to see the amazing effect! ✨
